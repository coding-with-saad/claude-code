# Model Context Protocol (MCP) vs Agent Skills

Model Context Protocol (MCP): An open standard for connecting AI models to real-world data and tools. An MCP “server” can host information from databases, design docs, or APIs and present it as context to the AI on demand. Instead of hard-coding context or repeatedly pasting data into prompts, the AI agent “pulls” exactly the needed information at runtime via MCP. MCP makes agents more autonomous, as they can fetch up-to-date facts, run queries, or use tools seamlessly.

Agent Skills: Modular capability packages that an AI agent can load when needed. Think of a skill as a mini-app: it’s a folder of instructions, code, or prompts that teach the agent how to do something (e.g. “write a unit test” or “summarize a PDF”). Unlike MCP (which is about accessing external data), skills embed knowledge or logic into the agent. According to Spring.io, “Agent Skills are modular folders of instructions, scripts, and resources… that AI agents can discover and load on demand”. They allow developers to extend an agent’s abilities without changing its core logic – the agent simply activates the appropriate skill when a prompt matches its description.

Many developers still work in traditional code-centric environments (multiple monitors, IDEs, etc.) where they manually write prompts or code for the AI. In these manual prompting workflows, a person crafts each instruction. This can be effective for simple, well-known tasks but quickly becomes cumbersome as tasks grow complex. By contrast, Agent Skills and MCP provide automation. Agent Skills let the AI automatically invoke specialized capabilities (so you don’t have to type every step), and MCP lets the AI pull in needed data or tools at runtime. Together, these reduce the need for a human to continuously guide the AI, enabling agents to work more independently and reliably.
