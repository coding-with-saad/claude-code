## Cost Analysis

### 5-Year Total Cost of Ownership

**Scenario: 100 AI-Assisted Workers**

**SaaS Approach:**
```
Year 1: 100 users × $79/month × 12 = $94,800
Year 2: 100 users × $79/month × 12 = $94,800
Year 3: 120 users × $79/month × 12 = $113,760 (growth)
Year 4: 120 users × $85/month × 12 = $122,400 (price increase)
Year 5: 150 users × $85/month × 12 = $153,000 (growth)

Total 5-Year Cost: $578,760
```

**Digital FTE Approach:**
```
Year 1: Development ($100k) + Operation ($24k) + Maintenance ($36k) = $160,000
Year 2: Operation ($24k) + Maintenance ($36k) = $60,000
Year 3: Operation ($30k) + Maintenance ($40k) + Enhancement ($20k) = $90,000
Year 4: Operation ($30k) + Maintenance ($40k) = $70,000
Year 5: Operation ($36k) + Maintenance ($40k) + Major Update ($30k) = $106,000

Total 5-Year Cost: $486,000

Savings vs SaaS: $92,760 (16% less)
```
